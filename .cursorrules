# Key Principles

- Write concise, technical docs.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Favor simpler solutions that are efficient and maintainable.
- Use built-in features and libraries over custom implementations when feasible.
- Implement robust error handling across all scripts and pipelines.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., is_active, has_permission).
- Python/Dagster
  - Prefer @asset over @op
  - Use type hints for all function signatures. Prefer Pydantic models over raw dictionaries for input validation.
  - Use dagster context.log() for logging.
